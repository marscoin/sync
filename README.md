## Overview

Welcome to the official Marscoin blockchain synchronization site. This repository provides the latest blockchain snapshots for quick and reliable Marscoin node synchronization.

## What is Marscoin?

Marscoin (MARS) is a planetary cryptocurrency launched in 2014 with the ambitious goal of supporting Mars settlement and establishing a financial system for the Red Planet. It operates as a decentralized cryptocurrency without the control of any single entity, including any Earth-based government or organization. Marscoin is derived from the Litecoin fork of Bitcoin and aims to serve as the primary currency for potential Mars colonies, independent of Earth's economy.
